        <h1>Sun/Pacman<h1>
        </div>
          <br>
          <p>This is a assignment that I did in my other MTEC class. It look simple but the coding is a bit complicated.
            This was a good project to show because although it was a bit of a struggle to get this done, it was a good learning experience and it was intersting to learn how to code interactive animations like this.<p>
              <br>
          <p>You interact with it by putting your mouse over the sun and pacman will appear. To move the back man you need to use the arrow keys to move it left or right.<p>
            <br>
            <img src="pacman.gif" class="gif">

            <div class="project-title">
            <h1>House<h1>
            </div>
              <p>This is a another assignment that I did in my other MTEC class. This one is more simple because it was just a mouse click.
                This was the first interactive animation I did in that class.<p>
                  <br>
              <p>You interact with it by clicking your mouse anywhere on the screen. The doors and window turn white and chimney smoke comes out when you click the screen. <p>
